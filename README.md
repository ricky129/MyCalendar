This is a java project I created by myself. I wanted to learn new stuff like new constructs and logic in java, a language I studied in high school and I've always liked. The events can be managed either via SQL or via the provided csv file. SQL files are provided if you want to use a localhost server.

I used AI to learn and understand the code I didn't know, that's why somewhere you'll find comments explaining the effect of some code. I believe AI is a powerful learning tool and should be used as so, rather than copying everything it generates without understanding it beforehand.

This project is now retired and I'm moving on to other ones. Stay tuned!
